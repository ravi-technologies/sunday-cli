# Use Cases: AI Agents with Their Own Inbox

This document explores why giving AI agents their own email address and phone number is transformative for autonomous agent capabilities.

## The Core Problem

The modern internet assumes every user has an email address and phone number. Nearly every meaningful action online requires one or both:

- Creating an account
- Verifying identity
- Receiving confirmations
- Completing 2FA
- Getting notifications

Without their own inbox, AI agents hit a wall. They must pause and wait for a human to:
1. Receive the verification code
2. Read it
3. Relay it back to the agent

This creates a **human bottleneck** that breaks the autonomy that makes agents useful.

## What This Enables

### 1. True Account Creation

Agents can independently create accounts on any service:

| Scenario | Without Sunday | With Sunday |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Sign up for a SaaS tool | Agent waits for human to forward OTP | Agent receives OTP directly, completes signup |
| Create social media account | Blocked at phone verification | Agent verifies via SMS |
| Register for API access | Stuck at email confirmation | Agent clicks verification link |

**Example workflow:**
```
Agent needs to use Notion API
→ Creates Notion account with Sunday email
→ Receives verification email
→ Extracts verification link
→ Completes signup
→ Generates API key
→ Proceeds with task
```

### 2. Autonomous Authentication

Many services require ongoing verification:

- **Login 2FA**: "Enter the code we sent to your phone"
- **Sensitive actions**: "Confirm this change via email"
- **Session verification**: "Click the link to verify it's you"

With their own inbox, agents handle these without interruption.

### 3. Service Interactions That Require Confirmation

Real-world tasks often involve confirmations:

| Task | Confirmation Required |
|------|----------------------|
| Book a flight | Itinerary sent via email |
| Schedule an appointment | Confirmation SMS |
| Place an order | Order receipt + tracking |
| Cancel a subscription | Cancellation confirmation |
| Submit a form | Submission receipt |

Agents can complete the full loop: take action → receive confirmation → verify success → proceed.

### 4. Accessing Gated Content

Much of the internet is behind email gates:

- **Research papers**: "Enter email to download"
- **Reports & whitepapers**: "Get the PDF in your inbox"
- **Gated tools**: "Start free trial with email"
- **API documentation**: "Sign up to view full docs"
- **Datasets**: "Request access via email"

Agents can access this content autonomously.

### 5. Monitoring and Alerts

Agents can subscribe to receive updates:

- Price drop alerts from e-commerce sites
- Stock/inventory notifications
- News alerts and newsletters
- Service status updates
- Calendar reminders
- Shipping notifications

**Example:** An agent monitoring prices across 20 sites can sign up for alerts on each, then aggregate and analyze incoming notifications.

### 6. Multi-Step Business Processes

Complex workflows often span multiple services:

```
Research Task:
1. Sign up for industry newsletter (email verification)
2. Create account on data provider (phone verification)
3. Register for webinar (email confirmation)
4. Download gated report (email required)
5. Sign up for competitor's trial (email + SMS verification)
```

Each step requires inbox access. Without it, each step blocks on human intervention.

### 7. Acting as a Representative

Agents can handle communications on behalf of users:

- Respond to automated customer service flows
- Complete support ticket processes
- Handle subscription management
- Process returns and refunds
- Schedule appointments with confirmation

## What This Prevents

### 1. Human Bottleneck in Agent Workflows

**Before:** Agent autonomy is an illusion. Every verification creates a stop-and-wait.

```
Agent working → needs OTP → stops → waits for human →
human checks email → human relays code → agent resumes
```

**After:** Agents work continuously without interruption.

### 2. Credential Sharing Security Risks

**Before:** Agents need access to human's email to read OTPs.

Problems:
- Agent can see all personal emails
- Human's email credentials exposed
- No isolation between agent tasks and personal life
- Potential for accidental data access

**After:** Complete isolation. Agent has its own inbox with only its own messages.

### 3. Inbox Pollution

**Before:** Every service an agent signs up for sends emails to human's inbox.

- Marketing emails
- Newsletters
- Service notifications
- Password reset spam
- Promotional offers

**After:** Agent's subscriptions stay in agent's inbox. Human's inbox stays clean.

### 4. Identity Conflation

**Before:** Agent actions are tied to human's identity.

- Services think a human signed up
- Human's phone number is registered with random services
- No clear audit trail of what agent did vs. human did

**After:** Clear separation.
- Agent has its own identity
- Human's personal info isn't spread across services
- Clear record of agent's registrations

### 5. Scalability Limits

**Before:** One human, one inbox. Agent tasks queue behind human attention.

**After:** Each agent (or task, or project) can have its own inbox. Parallel autonomous operation.

### 6. Privacy Leakage

**Before:** Human's real phone number and email given to every service.

- Data brokers aggregate it
- Spam and robocalls increase
- Personal info in countless databases

**After:** Agent uses a separate identity. Human's personal info stays private.

## Real-World Use Case Examples

### Software Evaluation Agent

An agent tasked with evaluating project management tools:

1. Signs up for Asana trial (email verification)
2. Signs up for Monday.com trial (email verification)
3. Signs up for ClickUp trial (phone verification)
4. Signs up for Notion trial (email verification)
5. Receives all onboarding emails
6. Accesses each platform
7. Compares features
8. Reports findings

Without own inbox: 4 separate verification interruptions, plus ongoing marketing emails to human.

### E-commerce Price Monitor

An agent tracking prices for a user:

1. Creates accounts on 15 e-commerce sites
2. Adds items to wishlists
3. Subscribes to price alerts
4. Receives notifications when prices drop
5. Aggregates and reports to user

Without own inbox: Would need human's email exposed to 15 retailers, endless marketing emails.

### Travel Booking Agent

An agent booking a trip:

1. Searches for flights
2. Creates airline account (email verification)
3. Books flight (confirmation to email)
4. Searches for hotels
5. Creates hotel account (phone verification)
6. Books hotel (confirmation to email)
7. Receives all confirmations
8. Compiles itinerary for user

Without own inbox: Multiple interruptions, human's contact info shared with travel companies.

### Job Application Agent

1. Creates accounts on job boards (email verification)
2. Submits applications
3. Receives application confirmations
4. Receives interview requests
5. Receives follow-up communications

### Research Assistant Agent

An agent conducting market research:

1. Signs up for industry publications (email required)
2. Registers for analyst reports (email gate)
3. Creates accounts on data platforms (verification required)
4. Subscribes to competitor newsletters
5. Registers for industry webinars
6. Collects and synthesizes information

Without own inbox: Blocked at every gate, human's inbox polluted with industry spam.

### Customer Service Agent

An agent handling support tasks:

1. Initiates support ticket (email required)
2. Receives ticket confirmation
3. Receives agent responses
4. Responds to follow-up questions
5. Receives resolution confirmation
6. Gets satisfaction survey

## The Bigger Picture

Giving AI agents their own inbox is about **removing the assumption that only humans do things on the internet**.

The internet was built for humans. Every form, every verification, every confirmation assumes a human with an email and phone. AI agents inherit a world not built for them.

Sunday bridges this gap. It gives agents the identity primitives they need to operate in a human-designed digital world.

This isn't just convenience—it's what enables agents to go from "assistants that help humans do things" to "autonomous actors that do things on behalf of humans."
